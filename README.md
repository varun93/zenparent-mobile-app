# zenparent-mobile-app
Android and IOS Mobile app for accessing zenparent portal.

This was a cross-platform React based mobile application developed way back in 2017 during my time at Zenparent. The business is  defunct as of 2019, so don't be surprised to see some harcoded API keys in the code(which is a bad practice in the first place). Although this was my first React project, I remember trying to incorportate as many best practices at the time. The mobile app for both Android and IOS versions were stable at the time, the links have been taken down at this point in time.

I believe this project could be a useful template for those who are looking at:
- Building cross platform React applications with Cordova.
- React Redux templates.
- Webpack configurations. 

The was integrated with 
- Google and FB social oauth plugins for login.
- Clevertap and Google Analytics for tracking user app activity.
- Branch for deep-linking.

The app can be built with webpack, has a both dev and production config. You can easily replace it with create-react-app and things should work out fine.
