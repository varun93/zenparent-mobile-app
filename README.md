# zenparent-mobile-app
Android and IOS Mobile app for accessing zenparent portal.

This was a cross-platform mobile application developed in React way back in 2017 during my time at Zenparent. The business is 
defunct as of 2019, so don't be surprised to see some harcoded API keys in the code(which is a bad practice in the first place).
Although this was my first React project, I remember trying to incorportate as much best practices at the time. The mobile app 
was for both Android and IOS versions were extremely stable at the time, the links are taken down at this time.

For those who are looking at building cross platform React applications with Cordova I am sure this would serve you well.

The app can be built with webpack, has a both dev and production config.
